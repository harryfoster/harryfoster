# Harry Foster - Personal Profile
Greetings, I am a London based Sysadmin with a focus on telecoms and networking. 
Would love to sink my teeth into some projects that are fun to work on, and 
actually useful for people.

By no means an expert programmer, but I've dabbled in most of the languages
and messed with a few frameworks. Commits are a bit light on Github because
I mainly deal with an internal Gitlab instance.
